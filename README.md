#Yet Another URL Shortener!
##(Which is somewhat useless when it itself does not have a tiny URL, but you get the picture)
###How to use:

Simply append "/new/http://www.yourURL.com" to this site's URL and activate!

Prepare to have your mind blown when it returns a JSON object with a new, shortened URL!

Wow! It forwards you to the saved URL! LIKE MAGIC!

Uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose.
